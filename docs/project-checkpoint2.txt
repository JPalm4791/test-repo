So far, I have joined the team repo for this project and have started reading through some of the documents. Sam was incredibly helpful with joining the repo and refreshed my memory on how to successfully do so. I haven't made any XML attempts yet on the documents, because I wanted to wait until our next team meeting to get some clarification. I have read through some of the documents and I believe this will be an interesting project for sure.
